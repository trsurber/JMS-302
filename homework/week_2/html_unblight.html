            <p>Many of America's once great cities have suffered recently as people move in masses to the suburbs, leaving behind empty houses and streets.</p>
            <p>UnBlight brings together journalists, policymakers, advocates, and students to search for ways to combat blight.</p>
            <p>Mercer University, the Center for Collaborative Journalism (CCJ), and the Sunlight Foundation are hosting Unblight.
